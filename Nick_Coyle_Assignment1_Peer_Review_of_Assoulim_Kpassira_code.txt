Peer review for Assoulim
I like your project because it works and prints what it is supposed to print. I also like that you did the extra credit successfully. I think you are off to a great start here and just have a few minor things you could change that we talked about in class. Mostly, I noticed you don't use the constants again after you declare them. It's small things for the most part, but you're code works and is nicely organized.

Line 8. For this assignment, we are supposed to name our class Histogram, not main.
Line 22, 23, 25 You call the function createBar and pass a char literal 'T' but you defined a constant on line 13 to hold this value, so why don't you pass the constant?
Line 35 you have a call to emptyRow() just on its own line, not consistent with other function calls
Line 60 you call createAxis(1000000) but pass a literal value, why don't you use the constant you defined on line 16?
Line 73, you calculate length of the string "Presidential Elections" but why? You passed that in as a parameter, so use it instead header.length();
Line 73, you calculate 40 - headerLen/2-1 but this is costly because it runs each time the for loop runs. So it would be more efficient to declare that outside the loop like this :
int headerLen = "Presidential Elections".length();
int spaces = 40 - headerLen/ 2 - 1;
for (int i = 1; i <= spaces; i++) {
Line 95 you can declare your calculations before the for loop again.
Line 113 you can declare your calculations before the for loop again.
Line 128 you have hardcoded 6 as the number of times the for loop will run, can you make it perform a calculation using the width of the screen to determine how many times it will print the axis?
